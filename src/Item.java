// ITEM that grants x amount of HEALTH.


// ITEM that grants x amount of DEFENSE.


// ITEM that grants x amount of DAMAGE / ATTACK.

// Other ITEMs...

// So, are ITEMs gonna be separate classes (doing too much)
// or are they gonna be instances of the Item class?
// If it's the latter, what about unused methods? Bc some will heal, damage, buff exclusively.
